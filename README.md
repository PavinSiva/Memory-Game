 Memory Game

Overview
The Memory Game is a classic matching game where players need to match pairs of cards with identical emojis. The game tests your memory by flipping two cards at a time and trying to find matching pairs. The game ends once all pairs have been matched.

Features
- **Randomized emoji cards**: The emojis are shuffled each time the game is started.
- **Match pairs**: When two cards match, they remain flipped.
- **Reset functionality**: Players can reset the game to start over by clicking the "Reset Game" button.
- **Animations**: Cards flip with smooth animations when clicked.

 How to Play
1. Click on any card to flip it over.
2. Click another card to try and find a matching pair.
3. If the two cards match, they will remain flipped over.
4. If they do not match, they will flip back over after a short delay.
5. Continue until all pairs have been matched.
6. Press the "Reset Game" button to start a new game.
